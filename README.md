# Wag The Pig

What's in a name?
This project started as "The What Game Do We Want To Play Game?"
i.e. that game you play before you play a game
that actually no one wanted to play
but you have to play before you
can play a game you do want to play.
I know, right?
Anyway, that acronymed as
TWGDWWTPG
which sounds a bit like
"wag the pig"
if you say it out loud.

Look, just imagine the best possible GIF
of a cheerful shrug right here.
